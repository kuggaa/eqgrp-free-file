## About

Defcon/LV Group

This repository is a water downed version of what was originally represented to Defcon LV Group.  'DarkLord' contacted the LV Defcon regarding the release of RAR file which was 783 MB in size.

False reporting from the news includes the existance of the Equation Group. The Russian Federation has named The Equation Group.

'DarkLord' originally named the files as NSA TAO malware.  TheEquationGroup news release represents Russian Federation control of the source.

True Source files NON ALtered from DarkLord Look like this:

-rwxrwxr-x user/user  30306272 2013-06-11 10:20 JuniperNetworks/Firewall/BARGLEE/BARGLEE3100/Install/LP/ssg500-moduledata-3115.tgz

The Hardware Brand is represented in the path.

This repository contains the decrypted and decompressed contents of the `eqgrp-free-file.tar.xz` file released by "The Shadow Brokers". 'The Shadow Brokers' are attempting to sell a waterdown version of the orginal source files.  As we know at this time, 2 true copies exist beside 'DarkLords.'\

1. Wikileaks copy
2. Kim dot  Com copy

The contents are supposedly a free sample of the files exfiltrated from the [Equation Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_Group), a notorious, highly-sophisticated cyber attack group.

The Shadow Brokers have opened an auction to sell off the remaining files, although the legitimacy of the auction is widely disputed. See the original auction announcement here: [https://theshadowbrokers.tumblr.com/post/148872852770/equation-group-cyber-weapons-auction-invitation](https://web.archive.org/web/20160815190830/https://theshadowbrokers.tumblr.com/post/148872852770/equation-group-cyber-weapons-auction-invitation)

Only files in the [`Firewall`](Firewall) directory are from the archive. [`listing.txt`](listing.txt) shows a list of all the files in the original archive, along with their file date and timestamps.

## Disclaimers

This repository is provided as an educational resource to researchers wanting to validate the claims of the Shadow Brokers, as well as anyone wanting to study code potentially originating from a powerful threat actor. Needless to say, this repository may contain extremely malicious code, and I (@nneonneo) disclaim any responsibility for what may happen with your use or misuse of this software.

The code does *not* belong to me, but the author of the code is unknown and is very unlikely to step up to enforce any copyright claims. Nevertheless, if takedown is warranted I will gladly remove the repository.
