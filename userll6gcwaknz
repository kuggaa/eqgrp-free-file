Little attention has been given to The ShadowBrokers (EquationGroup Leak) email address.
The email username: userll6gcwaknz@tutanota.com -which is not likely a generated username- used in the leak seems to be based on the manga "Code Geass".
 
If it's the case, LL6 is a reference to Lelouch Lamperouge VI Britannia. A quite intelligent strategist who manipulated and outmaneuvered his enemies in order to create world peace by defeating the british empire (Britannia).
